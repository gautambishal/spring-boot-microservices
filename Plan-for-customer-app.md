# Solution Design for Customer App

## 1. Solution Design Overview

This section provides a comprehensive design for the Customer App using various diagrams and documentation to describe the proposed solution. The aim is to fulfill the requirements and provide a clear structure for implementation and testing.

### 1.1 Use Cases

#### Use Case: Customer Queue Management

- **Actors**: Customer, System, Shop Operator
- **Preconditions**: The shop is configured, and the app is active.
- **Steps**:
    1. Customer joins the queue through the app.
    2. System assigns a position in the queue.
    3. Shop operator views the queue status.
    4. Customer is served, and their served count is updated.
- **Postconditions**: Customer is removed from the queue.

#### Use Case: Menu Browsing and Order Placement

- **Actors**: Customer, System
- **Preconditions**: Menu is configured in the system.
- **Steps**:
    1. Customer views the coffee menu.
    2. Customer places an order.
    3. System saves the order and updates queue details.
- **Postconditions**: Order details are recorded and accessible by the shop operator.

### 1.2 Concept Diagram

#### Components:

- **Customer App**: Allows customers to interact with the shop (e.g., join queues, place orders).
- **Backend Service**: Manages data processing, APIs, and security.
- **Database**: Stores customer, shop, and queue-related data.
- **Shop Operator App**: Allows operators to manage the queue and orders.

```
Customer App --> Backend Service --> Database

```

### 1.3 Sequence Diagram

#### Example: Customer Joins the Queue

1. Customer App sends a "Join Queue" request to the backend.
2. Backend validates the request and assigns a queue position.
3. Queue details are saved in the database.
4. Backend sends a confirmation response to the Customer App.

### 1.4 Data Design

#### Tables:

- **Customer**: id, name, served_count
- **Queue**: id, shop_id, queue_size
- **Order**: id, customer_id, order_details
- **Shop**: id, location, menu

### 1.5 Data Flow Diagram

1. Customer App interacts with Backend APIs.
2. Backend retrieves and updates data in the database.
3. Shop Operator App queries the backend for queue and order management.

## 2. Coding and Technology Standards

### 2.1 Coding Standards

- Follow Clean Code principles.
- Use RESTful API conventions.
- Implement SOLID principles.
- Adhere to the naming convention: camelCase for variables, PascalCase for classes.

### 2.2 Security Standards

- Secure APIs with JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
- Ensure HTTPS for secure communication.
- Encrypt sensitive data using AES.
- Enable RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) for shop operators and admins.

## 3. Security Solution

- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication.
- **Authorization**: Role-based access for different user types.
- **Data Protection**: Encrypt passwords and sensitive customer data.
- **Monitoring**: Enable logging and monitoring with tools like ELK Stack or AWS CloudWatch.

## 4. API Endpoints

### Customer Endpoints:

- `POST /api/v1/customers/join-queue`: Allows a customer to join the queue.
- `GET /api/v1/customers/menu`: Retrieves the coffee menu.
- `POST /api/v1/customers/place-order`: Places an order.

### Shop Operator Endpoints:

- `GET /api/v1/shop-operator/queue`: Retrieves the queue status.
- `POST /api/v1/shop-operator/serve-customer`: Marks a customer as served.
- `GET /api/v1/shop-operator/orders`: Retrieves customer orders.

## 5. Testing Plan

### 5.1 Backend Testing

- Use Postman or cURL to test API endpoints.
- Write unit tests for service and repository layers using JUnit.
- Implement integration tests for end-to-end API flows using MockMVC.

### 5.2 Database Testing

- Verify data consistency using SQL queries.
- Use database migration tools (e.g., Liquibase) to test schema changes.

### 5.3 Automated Testing

- Set up CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions or Jenkins.
- Automate test runs using JUnit and Mockito.
